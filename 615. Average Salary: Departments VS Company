Write an SQL query to report the comparison result (higher/lower/same) of the average salary of employees in a department to the company's average salary.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Explanation: 
In March, the company's average salary is (9000+6000+10000)/3 = 8333.33...
The average salary for department '1' is 9000, which is the salary of employee_id '1' since there is only one employee in this department. So the comparison result is 'higher' since 9000 > 8333.33 obviously.
The average salary of department '2' is (6000 + 10000)/2 = 8000, which is the average of employee_id '2' and '3'. So the comparison result is 'lower' since 8000 < 8333.33.

With he same formula for the average salary comparison in February, the result is 'same' since both the department '1' and '2' have the same average salary with the company, which is 7000.


Q: get pay_month, dept_id, comparison result 
-- comparing avg salary by dept each month to avg company overall by month 
-- to get month and year from date format, we use date_format(date, "%Y-%m")

with cte as (
select s.pay_date,
       date_format(s.pay_date, "%Y-%m") as pay_month,
       e.department_id, 
       avg(s.amount) over (partition by date_format(pay_date, "%Y-%m")) as avg_all, 
       avg(s.amount) over (partition by e.department_id, date_format(pay_date, "%Y-%m")) as avg_dept
from salary s 
join employee e on s.employee_id = e.employee_id 
)
select date_format(pay_date, "%Y-%m") as pay_month, 
       department_id, 
       case when avg_dept > avg_all then "higher"
            when avg_dept < avg_all then "lower" 
            else "same"
        end as "comparison" 
from cte 
group by pay_month, department_id 
order by pay_month desc, department_id
