#Write an SQL query to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. 
#A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.
#Return the result table in any order.

#Explanation: 
#We are looking for users who were active (made at least 1 activity) during the last 30 days ending in 2019-07-27
#In order to do so, we want to search by date and count number of users on a given date 
#To find activity in a certain period, we use date_sub
