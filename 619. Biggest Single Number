Table: MyNumbers

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains an integer.
 

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Write an SQL query to report the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
Example 2:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.

Q: query the single number
C: must be the largest AND appeared only once in the table 

Step 1: extract a group of numbers that occured only once 
Step 2: select the largest number from the list above 

Option 1: using cte table
with cte as (
select num, 
       count(num) as count_num
from mynumbers 
group by num
having count(num) = 1
)
select ifnull(max(num), null) as num 
from cte 

Option 2: using subquery 
select ifnull(max(num),null) as num
from (select num
     from mynumbers
     group by num
     having count(num) = 1)
