Write an SQL query to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:

| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |

+----+-------+--------+-----------+

| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
Explanation: Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.


Q: query employee name 
C: employee salary > manager salary 
-- because employee and manager details are in 1 table, we will do self join 
-- conditions to join: manager id in employee table = employee id in manager table and employee salary in employee table > employee salary in manager table

with cte as (
select e.name as "Employee"
from employee e, employee m 
where e.managerId = m.id 
and e.salary > m.salary 
)
select Employee
from cte 

OR

with cte as (
select e.name as "Employee"
from employee e 
join employee m
where e.managerId = m.id 
and e.salary > m.salary
)
select Employee
from cte
